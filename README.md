<p>
1. Ticket Review and Acknowledgment
</p>

</p>
<p>
Review the ticket details—such as the user’s description, priority, and any attachments—to understand the issue. Acknowledge the ticket by replying to the user with a brief message (e.g., “We’ve received your request and are investigating”) to set expectations.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
2. Assignment and Communication
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Assign the ticket to the appropriate department or agent if it’s not already routed correctly. Update the ticket’s priority (ex: low, medium, high) based on urgency and impact, following your help desk’s guidelines. Add relevant tags or notes to streamline tracking and resolution.
  
</p>
<p>
3. Investigation and Troubleshooting
</p>
<br />
<p>

</p>
<p>
Analyze the issue by checking system logs, replicating it if possible, or referencing knowledge base articles. If needed, request additional details from the user via the ticket’s reply feature. Document your findings in the ticket’s internal notes for clarity and team visibility.

</p>
<p>
4. Resolution or Escalation
</p>
<br />
<p>

</p>
<p>
Apply a fix if within your scope (ex: resetting a password or guiding the user through steps). Test the solution to ensure it works. If the issue requires higher-level support, escalate the ticket to the appropriate team or technician, providing a detailed summary of your troubleshooting steps in the notes.

</p>
<p>
5. Follow-Up and Closure
</p>
<br />
<p>

</p>
<p>
Once resolved, update the ticket with the solution details and mark it as closed. Notify the user through osTicket’s messaging system, explaining the fix and offering further assistance if needed. If applicable, ask for feedback to improve service quality.
